# calanderApp

Goal: The goal of this project is to create a clander app that can keep track of hours between 9-5. people can add events
and the infomation will be held in local storage. The app will use jQuery.

Some starter files were provided.
index.html and style.css

So far I have added the date to the page and I have put two hours with text areas and two save buttons. The value from the text area is saved into the frist spot in an array. the array is JSON and in local storage. I need to figure out a way to make the values from each hour to save into its own spot. I might have to use muiltple functions to save the value in its own spot. I will also need to make a way to write the stored values to the right hours. I am wondering if I can use a for loop.
